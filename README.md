# What languages I used
I used Java in this program.
# Decription
I made this Java program in Netbeans with some instructions I had to follow in my college project. The process of creating a simple currency converter program in Java typically involves using basic programming concepts such as loops and conditional statements to create a functional program that can take user input, process it, and provide the converted output. Which is how the program was coded.
# To access the app
All you need to do is run the file and follow the instruction given by the program.
